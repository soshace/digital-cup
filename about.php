            <p>A story well known in Australia, Jane and Glenn McGrath’s much-publicised experience with breast cancer
                led to the formation of what has become one of Australia’s most respected and recognised charities, the
                McGrath Foundation.</p>

            <p>Because of their experience came the belief that every family experiencing breast cancer in Australia
                should have access to the support of a breast care nurse shaping the McGrath Foundation’s mission is to
                ensure every family experiencing breast cancer in Australia has access to a breast care nurse no matter
                where they live or their financial situation. The Foundation estimates 150 McGrath Breast Care Nurses
                are needed to achieve this. Only then, will every family in this situation have access to optimal
                care.</p>

            <p>Today, the McGrath Foundation is considered to be one of Australia’s leading breast cancer support
                organisations, with over 25,000 Australian families supported by our 98 McGrath Breast Care Nurses
                nationally in the last five years</p>
